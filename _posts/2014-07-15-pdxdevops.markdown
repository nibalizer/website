description: I co-organize the <a href="http://pdxdevops.org/">PdxDevOps</a> user group with <a href="https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss">Alice Goldfuss</a>. Every month we feature presentations or structured conversations on the tooling and human processes around the DevOps meetup. Usually we are hosted by New Relic and food is provided by Volt recruiting. You can discover our upcomming meetings by checking out <a href="http://calagator.org/events/search?tag=pdxdevops">Calagator</a>, the home-grown and Open Source meetup replacement used in Portland. Recently, we have been discussing setting up a <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/">DevOpsDays</a> in Portland. If this interests you, contact me.
