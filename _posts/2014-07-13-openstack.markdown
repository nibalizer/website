description: Since 2014, I have worked with the OpenStack Infrastructure team. I help build out the testing and development infrastructure used by upstream OpenStack developers. This has included building one of the coolest CI systems around, as well as the opportunity to work with some of the smartest Open Source hackers on the planet.
